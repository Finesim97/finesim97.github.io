During my schooling years I taught myself Java SE/EE, played around with Linux server administration, and a little bit of electronic engineering.

After finishing my A levels with an 1.5, I had decided to also include my love of the life sciences in my career and
try to aqcuire practical wet lab experience, so I studied Biotechnology with a focus on Bioinformatics at the
University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer.

During my bachelor studies, I have been working as a programming tutor since my second term, providing research assistance in projects to my professor since my 5th and worked on projects like the [HiveHealth](https://www.hs-emden-leer.de/fachbereiche/technik/labore/fablab/projekte/hive-health/).

For my bachelor thesis I developed [a pipeline family](https://www.knutt.org) for the analysis of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) in anaerobic digestion ecosystems.

For my bachelor thesis I worked at the microbiology department of my university and developed pipelines to analyze SSU-rRNA reads and whole genome shotgun reads produced in the lab. This lead to my first [publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32620171/). I finished my bachelor studies with a 1.42.

To accquire more knowledge in the field of data analysis, especially machine learning and big data, I enrolled at the Data Science MSc programme at the Hochschule Darmstadt (h_da).
