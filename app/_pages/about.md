During my schooling years I taught myself Java SE/EE, played around with Linux server administration, and a little bit of electronic engineering.

After finishing my A levels with an 1.5, I decided to also include my biological interests in my career and
try to aqcuire practical wet lab experience, so I studied biotechnology with a focus on bioinformatics at the
University of Applied Science Emden/Leer. 

During my bachelor studies, I have been working as a programming tutor since my second term, providing research assistance in projects to my professor since my 5th and worked on projects like the [HiveHealth](https://www.hs-emden-leer.de/fachbereiche/technik/labore/fablab/projekte/hive-health/).

For my bachelor thesis I developed [a pipeline family](https://www.knutt.org) for the analysis of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) in anaerobic digestion ecosystems.

Since finishing my own confirmation in our small parish back in Schortens, I have been active as a catechist and showed teenagers how to grow as a catholic and nerd today.
