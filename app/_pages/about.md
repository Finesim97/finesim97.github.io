Engineering and experimenting always has been a passion for me. During my schooling years I taught myself 
Java SE, played around with Linux server administration and a little bit of electronic engineering.

After finishing my A levels with an 1.5, I had decided to also include my love of the life sciences in my career and
try to aqcuire practical wet lab experience, so I am currently studying biotechnology with a focus on bioinformatics at the
University of Applied Science Emden/Leer. 

During my bachelor studies I have been working as a programming tutor since my second term, providing research assistance in projects to my professor since my 5th and lead the software development of the [HiveHealth project](https://www.hs-emden-leer.de/fachbereiche/technik/labore/fablab/projekte/hive-health/).

Since finishing my own confirmation in our small parish back in Schortens, I have been active as a catechist and showed teenagers how to grow as a catholic and nerd today.
