This year marks the start of my personal website and blog. 

So: **Happy new Year!**

## Why am I doing this?
The time of the blog may be over. I have to say, at the moment of writing this post I am not actively following
any blog myself, so the question arises, what is the return on investment of maintaining something like this?
These are the main reasons for doing this in no particular order:
- **Online presence**: Having a public persona is a requirement for almost anything in this day and age.
- **Portofolio**: Talking about your great projects isn't enough, you need a central place to show them off.
- **Writing practice**: Around 90% of the media I consume is in english, but I am really scared of my active english withering away.
- **Project documentation**: A big part of mainting a project and finishing it is having a clear documentation, which defines your goals
and helps other people profiting from it. 

## What I am doing?
Every two weeks I want to post two posts on this page. The first one describing a project I worked on the last two weeks and another
one defining my next project. The project may be anything in the fields of computer science, molecular biology, bioinformatics, data science or dev ops. In molecular biology I will probably choose a topic in one of the *omics and write a little popular science article
on it. 

The goal would be to work on that project around 30min every day and so spend 7 to 10 hours on it. As an active time tracking proponent using toggl I will be able to keep record of the time I actually spent. Every project start will include a outline for my GTD system
and the finish post the actual tasks I have completed.

## Who am I?
To answer this question, check my (hopefully) current [About me](/about/) page.
