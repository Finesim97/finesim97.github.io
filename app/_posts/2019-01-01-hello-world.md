This year marks the start of my personal website and blog. 

So: **Happy new Year!**

## Why am I doing this?
The time of the blog may be over. I have to say, at the moment of writing this post, I am not actively following
any blog myself, so the question arises, what is the return on investment of maintaining something like this?
These are the main reasons for me doing this in no particular order:
- **Online presence**: Having a public persona is a requirement for almost anything in this day and age.
- **Portofolio**: Talking about your great projects isn't enough, you need a central place to show them off.
- **Writing practice**: Around 90% of the media I consume is in english, but I am really scared of my active english withering away.
- **Project documentation**: A big part of maintaining a project and finishing it is having a clear documentation, which defines your goals and helps other people profiting from it. 


## Who am I?
To answer this question, check my (hopefully) current [About me](/about/) page.
